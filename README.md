# MSDS 598: Introduction to Statistical Modeling
The repository associated with MSDS-598 at University of San Francisco in Spring 2022.

**Instructor:** Michael Ruddy

**Email**: mruddy@usfca.edu

**Class Time**: M, 6:30pm - 9:30pm Pacific

**Location:** Harney Science Center 136

**Office Hours**: 12pm - 1pm on Wednesdays, virtual  (Zoom link available on Canvas)

**Book**: No official book, but [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is very good and can be downloaded as a pdf for free.

**Syllabus**: Can be found [here](https://github.com/mgruddy/StatModeling_MSDS22/blob/main/Spring-2022-MSDS-598-01-Modeling-I.pdf)

**Course Requirements**: Students must have access to a functioning computer to complete this course. We will use Python and a Jupyter notebook environment extensively throughout this course. I suggest using a Python package manager like Anaconda (available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), scroll down for different Operating Systems). Google CoLab is also an interesting option for a notebook environment.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Understand the foundational ideas of elementary statistics including random variables, distributions, and hypothesis testing.
- Understand statistical models and the role they play in data-driven decision making.
- Use Python to obtain and prepare data for statistical analysis.
- Use Python to implement an appropriate statistical model on a data set.
- Give a contextually appropriate interpretation of a model and communicate conclusions resulting from the analysis.

## Course Overview

### Assessment

The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Participation** (20%): Students are expected to attend each class lecture unless they have a valid university-approved excuse. Similarly students are required to stay home if they have flu-like symptoms, or any other symptoms associated with COVID-19. Students are expected to participate in any in-class work/activities and to follow the Code of Conduct (below). All completion-graded work also falls in this category.
- **Assignments** (30%): Throughout the course I will assign homework. Homework is expected to be completed *individually*. All outside discussion/help should be disclosed upon turning in the assignment; otherwise this is considered cheating. Most homeworks will involve submitting a Jupyter notebook that is **neatly** and **appropriately** formatted. Late penalties are 10%/20%/50% for homework turned in less than one day/two days/one week late.
- **Quizzes** (20%): Quizzes will be conducted periodically via Canvas. These will be timed quizzes without access to outside resources (**not** open book) during scheduled class time.
- **Final Assignment** (30%): The final assignment will be similar to a long-form homework assignment that incorporates all of the concepts discussed in the course with a pre-determined real-world dataset. This may be completed in groups no larger than 3, but your group must be communicated to me before **February 19th**. The notebook submitted must follow strict formatting (guidelines to come) and you may be asked to also submit additional materials (such as an essay or presentation).

### Code of Conduct

As students will often be asked to share and discuss their work, and work on assignments with their peers, the code of conduct **MUST** be followed. Students are expected to be highly respectful of their peers during and outside of class to help foster an inclusive environment where everyone is comfortable making mistakes and contributing. When working as a group, it is every group member's responsibility to make sure everyone has input and understands the answers given.
